## Prelude

Investing is one of the most important things anyone should do as part of their
daily lives, yet such a small proportion of people do it. For those that do, a large
proportion of them start late.

It doesn't matter what background you come from - finance, business, sociology or
even medicine - the likelihood of you investing is hardly influenced by your
educational background. I know many people who have studied finance but are not
invested. What matters most in my opinion, is having a mindset to achieve a certain
financial goal. Having a target in mind keeps our spending habits in check and keeps
us driven to find out more about what is available out there.

## I Don't Know Where To Start

Naturally, people who don't study finance will have little to no clue about what
interest rates, leverage, dollar-cost averaging, valuations and discounted cash flow
are.

To the na√Øve, investing is this scary process where one puts money into an account
and magically prays that the value of it increases over time, while hoping to get
that money back one day from whichever account that money sits in.

Unfortunately, the Singapore education system (I can only speak for where I come from)
does little to provide financial literacy to the masses. Conversely, the masses often
have little to no interest in learning about financial literacy.

Let's address the former issue.

The truth is - most education systems around the world does not talk about money and
how it should/can be managed throughout one's lives. In the Singaporean context, we
are not taught how about Central Provident Fund (CPF) can be used to fund our retirement
and how we can make use of the money within it. Most people simply view their CPF monies
as money that they cannot tangibly see or touch until they're fifty-five. We are not taught how to invest, what we should invest in or *why* we should even invest in the first place.

Now hello beebers hi
