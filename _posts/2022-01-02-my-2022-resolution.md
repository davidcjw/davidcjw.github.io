2021 has been a great year for me. Born in the year of the monkey (based on the chinese zodiac), fortune tellers have said that 2021 would be a great year for monkeys in terms of career and relationships, not so much health. Though I'm someone who believes largely in myself, the aforementioned "predictions" have been somewhat true I must say.
