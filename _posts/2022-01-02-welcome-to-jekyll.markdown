Prelude:
For those who don't know who I am (which would be most of you), please read a short description of myself [here][about-me] :)

2021 has been a great year for me. Born in the year of the monkey (based on the chinese zodiac), fortune tellers have said that 2021 would be a great year for monkeys in terms of career and relationships, not so much health. Though I'm someone who believes largely in myself, the aforementioned "predictions" have been somewhat true I must say.

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
