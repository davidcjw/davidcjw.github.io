The goal of this article is not to educate, but to inform and keep myself accountable :)

#### Coding is not just for work

As an engineer, I enjoy coding. I enjoy coding for fun and not just for work.

At work, I'm a Machine Learning (ML) Engineer. My stack revolves largely around the main Python ML frameworks (`scikit-learn`, `tensorflow`, `xgboost`, etc) alongside cloud-based services, namely Google Cloud Platform (`GCP`), and DevOps tools like `Docker`, `Airflow` and even message queues.

#### Looking Back

In 2021, I improved a lot in terms of my main programming language (Python) and dabbled with many frameworks that are based on it. I improved on RESTful APIs, dabbled with `Rust` (but failed miserably) and worked on projects that used `AWS`.

#### What I've Planned

In 2022, I aim to explore the world of cryptocurrencies and learn more DevOps tools to boost my skillset. That being said, I'll need to find a use case for any of the technologies that I choose to learn. In summary, here's what I'm planning to learn in 2022:
- Smart Contracts ([Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) / [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.11/))
- [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine)
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)
- [ELK](https://www.elastic.co/)
- [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/)
